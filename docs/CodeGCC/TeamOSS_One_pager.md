### Enabling Greater Collaboration Across the Public Service

---
## Description for a fan favorite voting
Get ready for the next big thing in GCconnex! Team OSS is happy to introduce three new features that will enable further collaboration and deliver increased functionality to GC tools : embedded video, editing documents collaboratively in real-time, and ability to to see only your departments activity.

This project allows users to create and edit a single e-Doc, without multiple versions, within GCconnex, while enabling easy documents sharing with colleagues. It also has the added functionality of embedded video, where users can post external videos from popular sites like YouTube within GCconnex, just by posting the link. Lastly, the project also boasts the highly in-demand departmental search. This feature enables users to sort their searches based on what departmental information they provide in their profiles, while also allowing users to search the activities of other departments. Here, users can strategically search for more personalized information.

These highly requested features are not only within the radar of the 2015-2016 Work Plan, but also present cost-effective, noticeable upgrades to GCconnex, using tools users are already familiar with, while enabling external collaboration with GC tools.

## Most interesting insights observed by the team over the two days
Over the last two days, the team has made some interesting observations. The Elgg frameworks and functionality were some of the most interesting observations within the coding component of the project. With many using Elgg coding for the first time, this presented challenges in determining how to get the coding to do what we wanted it to do. Coding in PHP also presented similar challenges to the team. For the communications and marketing side of the team, finding out that we could contribute more to the team than initially thought was also observed during the two days.
