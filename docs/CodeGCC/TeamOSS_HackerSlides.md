### Enabling Greater Collaboration Across the Public Service

---

## Next big thing in GCconnex
Team OSS is happy to introduce three new features that will enable further collaboration and deliver increased functionality to GC tools.

---

### Embedded videos
Users can post external videos from Youtube, Vimeo and others just by putting the link in their page, blog or group discussion.

---

### Editing documents collaboratively in real-time (e-Docs)
Users can easily create links to [Etherpad](https://beta.etherpad.org/). Etherpad allows you to edit documents collaboratively in real-time. It's also Open Source Sotware.

__We used an Etherpad to collaborate during Code GCConnex!__

---

### Departmental Activity Tabs
Tabs to the Activity page that enables users to only there own department's activity as we all other activity (not your department).

---

These highly requested features are not only within the radar of the 2015-2016 Work Plan, but also present cost-effective, noticeable upgrades to GCconnex, using tools users are already familiar with, while enabling external collaboration with GC tools.
